# CountryExplorer

A React application that allows users to explore countries around the world using the REST Countries API. This project demonstrates skills in front-end development, API integration, and user interface design.

## Live Demo

[View the Live Demo](https://global-route.vercel.app/)

## Features

- Browse through all countries with essential information
- Search countries by name
- Filter countries by region
- View detailed information about each country
- Add countries to favorites (requires login)
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React with functional components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: Context API
- **Authentication**: Local storage-based authentication (simulated)
- **API**: REST Countries API
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## API Integration

This application uses the REST Countries API with the following endpoints:

1. `GET /all` - Fetch all countries
2. `GET /name/{name}` - Search countries by name
3. `GET /region/{region}` - Filter countries by region
4. `GET /alpha/{code}` - Get detailed information about a specific country

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/country-explorer.git
   cd country-explorer
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. To build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. To run tests
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## User Authentication

This application includes a simulated user authentication system:

- Users can register and log in
- User sessions are maintained using localStorage
- Authenticated users can add countries to their favorites
- Favorites are persisted in localStorage

## Testing

The application includes unit and integration tests covering key functionality:

- Component rendering
- API integration
- State management
- User interactions

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works well on:
- Mobile devices
- Tablets
- Desktop computers

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Rate Limiting
While developing, I encountered API rate limiting issues with the REST Countries API. To solve this, I implemented caching of API responses to reduce the number of requests.

### Challenge 2: State Management
Managing application state across multiple components was challenging. I solved this by using React Context API to create a centralized state that all components can access.

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
Loading all countries at once caused performance issues. I optimized this by implementing lazy loading and efficient filtering mechanisms.

## Future Improvements

- Implement real backend authentication
- Add more filtering options (population, area, etc.)
- Implement a theme switcher (light/dark mode)
- Add more detailed country information and visualizations
- Implement a map view of countries
